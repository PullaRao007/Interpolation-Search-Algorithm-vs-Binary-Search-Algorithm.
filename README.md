PROJECT: Retrieving, comparing, and presenting process profiling Data

TOPIC: Interpolation Search Algorithm vs Binary Search Algorithm.

ABOUT:
1. This project's goal is to extract system vs. user-level information from running programs and use it to compare the efficiency of     two algorithms. 
2. The two algorithms are Interpolation Search Algorithm vs Binary Search Algorithm.
3. To acheive the goal of this project, retrieving, comparing, and presenting process profiling data of these two algorithm has been	   done.
4. Total project is accomplished in python code platform.
5. Images of analysis of my results and findings on comparing the algorithms under different running conditions are attached in png      format can be observed here. 

GOAL:
1. Retrieving the process profiling data, such as memory usage, CPU usage, and page faults
2. Comparing the efficiency of two input algorithms or programs
3. Presenting the performance comparison results

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Install Anaconda Navigator - version 2.1.1
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5

LANGUAGES:
1. Python

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:
1. After installing the Anaconda Navigator - version 2.1.1, launch the Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5
2. Go to the source code folder which is named as AOS_project.mundru and upload all the files present in the folder into the files       section of the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Code will be seen in the cells of the Python 3 ipykernel environment.
4. Each cell can be executed by click on the run button and in the console output of each cell can be observed.
5. All the pie charts and tabular block results can be seen in the console of the Python 3 ipykernel.

RUNNING CONDITIONS:
1. Algorithm/Program A alone -- InterpolationSearchAlgorithm.py
2. Algorithm/Program B alone -- BinarySearchAlgorithm.py
3. Algorithms/Programs A and B concurrently --  InterpolationAndBinarySearchAlgorithms.py

LOOK UP:
1. What is Interpolation Search Algorithm?
2. What is Binary Search Algorithm?
3. Analysis of this two algorithm results and findings on comparing the algorithms under different running conditions.
All these information have been analyzed and documented and attached in this project as AOS_Documentation_Mundru.pdf.
